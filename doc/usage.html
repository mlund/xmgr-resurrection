<h1>Using xmgr</h1>
<p>
<h2><a NAME="execution">Execution</a></h2>
<p>
The interactive <b>xmgr</b> program is called <b>xmgr</b>, if used in batch 
mode, <b>grbatch</b>. 
If <b>grbatch</b> is not found, contact your system administrator, or see the 
section on installation. For grbatch to work properly it is important that it
be called <b>grbatch</b> as it is the name that distinguishes <b>xmgr</b> from 
<b>grbatch</b>. They are the same program, but when executed as 
<b>grbatch</b>, the X interface is not initialized and <b>grbatch</b> 
terminates at the end of execution without user intervention. 
<p>
Please note
that <b>grbatch</b> does not read the any X resource files, so that it can
be run from dumb terminals and over phone lines. Don't expect resource
settings used for <b>xmgr</b> to work for <b>grbatch</b>. See the section
on setting defaults using a <a href="#defaults"> <b>.xmgrrc</b> </a> file.

<h2><a NAME="commandline">Command line parameters</a></h2>
<p>
<DL>
<DT> <b>-autoscale</b> <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> or <i>xy</i>
<DD>
Autoscale the x axis, y axis, or both axes, overriding the settings for axes 
scaling and tick mark spacing  given in any parameter file specified by the -p
option.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
xmgr -autoscale x -p params.par data.dat
</pre>
Reads parameters from params.par and data from data.dat, but overrides
any settings for the X axis found in the parameter file.
<DT> -noauto  <i>y</i> or <i>y</i> or <i>xy</i>
<DD>
Suppress autoscaling on the given axis (axes). Use this when a data file 
has embedded commands that provide axes scaling and tick mark spacing.
<DT> -arrange <i>rows columns</i>
<DD>
Arrange graphs in column major order starting from the lower left corner in a 
grid <i>rows</i> by <i>columns</i>. For example, <i>-arrange 2 2</i> will 
position the first four graphs (0, 1, 2, 3) in a 2x2 matrix of graphs 
starting with graph 0 in the lower left corner of the plotting surface. 
This function is not as complete as the similar function found in 
<a href = "graphops.html#arrange"> Graph/Graph operations/Arrange </a>
and gives a sightly different result.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
xmgr -arrange 2 2
</pre>
Creates a 2x2 matrix of graphs.
<dt> -rows <i>rows</i>
<dd>Arrange the first <i>rows graphs</i> in <i>rows</i> rows.
<dt> -cols <i>columns</i>
<dd>
Arrange the first <i>columns</i> graphs in <i>columns</i> columns.
<dt> -results <i>results_file</i>
<dd>
Write the results of regression and anything else that gets written to 
the results popup to file <i>results_file</i>.
<dt> -device <i>device_number</i>
<dd>
Set the hardcopy device to <i>device_number</i>.
The device numbering follows:
<ul>
	<li>	1 .. PostScript landscape
	<li>	2 .. PostScript portrait
	<li>	3 .. FrameMaker .mif landscape
	<li>	4 .. FrameMaker .mif portrait
	<li>	5 .. HPGL landscape
	<li>	6 .. HPGL portrait
	<li>	7 .. InterLeaf landscape
	<li>	8 .. InterLeaf portrait
	<li>	9 .. PSTeX include 
	<li>   10 .. PSTeX landscape
	<li>   11 .. PSTeX portrait
</ul>
<p>
Example:
<pre>
xmgr -device 2
</pre>
Sets the hardcopy device to PostScript portrait.
<dt> -eps
<dd>
Tell the PostScript driver to produce EPS.
<dt> -printfile <i>graphics_output_file</i>
<dd>
Write the graphics output to file <i>graphics_output_file</i> rather than 
spool graphics data to a printer.
 <dt> -fixed <i>width height</i>
 <dt> -portrait
 <dt> -landscape
 <dt> -free
<dd>
Set the dimensions of the drawing area. Presently, there is no connection 
between the hardcopy drivers and these settings. This means that the printer 
needs to be set to conform to the dimensions of the drawing area.
<ul>
	<li>	-free - allow the drawing area to be resized (no 
			scrollbars will appear).
	<li>	-fixed <i>width height</i> - set the drawing area to have 
			dimensions <i>width and height</i>
	<li>	-portrait - set the drawing area to be 8.5x11 in portrait.
	<li>	-landscape - set the drawing area to be 8.5x11 in landscape.
</ul>
<dt> -batch <i>batch_file</i>
<dd>
Execute the commands in <i>batch_file</i> on startup. This command line 
switch is not the same as executing xmgr in batch mode as <b>grbatch</b>.
<p>
<dt> -noask
<dd>
Assume the answer is yes to all requests, This means that files will be 
overwritten without asking if they exist, and, if Exit is selected in
the GUI, <b>xmgr</b> will exit abruptly. This option can be used to 
overwrite existing files in batch mode. Be careful.
<p>
<dt> -graph <I>graph_number</i>
<dd>
Make <i>graph_number</i> the current graph. <i>Graph_number</i> is an 
integer between 0 and maxgraph-1 (by default maxgraph, the maximum number
of graphs, is 10).
<p>
For example, to activate four graphs and read data to each graph:
<p>
<pre>
xmgr -arrange 2 2 data0.dat -graph 1 data1.dat -graph 2 data2.dat -graph 3 
data3.dat
</pre>
<p>
This command creates 4 graphs arranged in a 2x2 matrix, and reads a file
into each graph. 
<p>
<dt> -graphtype <i>graph_type</i>
<dd>
Set the current graph type to <i>graph_type</i>. Where <i>graph_type</i> is 
one of:
<p>
<ul>
	<li> xy           linear scaling along both x and y.
	<li> logx         linear scaling in y, log scaling in x., 
	<li> logy         linear scaling in x, log scaling in y.
	<li> logxy        log scaling in both x and y.
	<li> bar          vertical bar chart.
	<li> hbar         horizontal bar chart.
	<li> stackedbar   vertical stacked bar chart.
	<li> stackedhbar  horizontal stacked bar chart.
</ul>
	<dt> -type <i>data_set_type</i>
<dd>
The format of the next data source is <i>data_set_type</i>. Where 
<i>data_set_type</i> is one of <b>xydx</b> (XY data with error bars along X), 
<b>xydy</b> (XY data with error bars along Y), <b>xydxdx</b> (XY 
data with error bars along X of differing values), <b>xydydy</b> (XY data with 
error bars along Y of differing values), <b>xydxdy</b> (error bars along X 
and Y), <b>xyr</b> (a circle drawn at XY of radius R) and <b>xyhilo</b> 
(XY data with high-low open-close data). This setting remains in effect until 
a new format type is specified.
	<dt> -ihl <i>IHL_formatted_file</i>
<dd>
Assume <i>IHL_formatted_file</i> or the next source of data is in IHL 
format (a local format).
<p>
	<dt> -nxy
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X1, Y1, Y2, ..., Yn.
<p>
	<dt> -xydx
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y DX
<p>
	<dt> -xydy
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y DY
<p>
	<dt> -xydxdx
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y DX1 DX2
<p>
	<dt> -xydydy
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y DY1 DY2
<p>
	<dt> -xydxdy
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y DX DY
<p>
	<dt> -xyz
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y Z where Z is a value drawn as 
text at X, Y.
<p>
	<dt> -xyr
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X Y R, where a circle of radius R 
is drawn at X, Y.
<p>
	<dt> -xybox
<dd>
The format of the next data source is XMIN YMIN XMAX YMAX VALUE, where 
(XMIN, YMIN) is the lower left-hand corner of a rectangle and (XMAX, YMAX) 
are the upper right-hand corner of a rectangle. VALUE is an integer used to 
specify the color to use to fill the rectangle. To set the fill, use 
Graph/Symbols and set the fill style to anything but None.
	<dt> -boxplot
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X AVG
<p>
	<dt> -ihl
<dd>
The format of the next data source is in IHL format, this format leads to 
a data set of type XY.
<p>
	<dt> -hilo
<dd>
The format of the next data source is X HIGH LOW OPEN CLOSE, where a symbol 
denoting the open, close, the high and the low values for an observation is
drawn at X.
<p>
	<dt> -netcdf <i>netCDF file</i>
	<dt> -netcdfxy [<i>xvar</i> or <i>"null"] yvar</i>
<dd>
Where <i>xvar</i> and <i>yvar</i> are the names of the variables to read.
if <i>xvar</i> == "null", then load the index of yvar.
These command line options may be used to read variables from
a netCDF file. For example:

<p>
<pre>
xmgr -netcdf t.nc -netcdfxy null y
</pre>
<p>

Reads y from t.nc and loads to X the index (starting from 1).

<p>
<pre>
xmgr -netcdf t.nc -netcdfxy x y -netcdfxy x1 y1
</pre>
<p>

Reads x and y from t.nc, then x1 and y1 from the same file.
2 sets are created, both of type XY, one with (x, y), the
other composed of (x1, y1).

another example reading data from 2 CDF files:

<p>
<pre>
xmgr -netcdf t.nc -netcdfxy x y -netcdf t2.nc -netcdfxy x1 y1
</pre>
<p>
	<dt> -saveall <i>filename</i>
<dd>
Write all active sets to <i>filename</i>.
<p>
	<dt> -wd
<dd>
Set the current working directory. This option can be used to read
files from several different directories. For example:

<p>
<pre>
xmgr -wd examples mlo.dat -wd ../moredat brw.d hilo.dat
</pre>
Unfortunately, this option not allow wild cards, as they are expanded in 
the current directory only.
<p>
	<dt> -image <i>X_window_dump_file</i>
<dd>
Read the window dump file <i>X_window_dump_file</i>. The format is the same as 
generated by xwd or Frame's capture utility.
<p>
	<dt> -imagexy <i>X Y</i>
<dd>
Set the upper left-hand corner position of the image at screen coordinates 
(X, Y). Note that screen coordinates have as their origin the upper left-hand 
corner of the drawing area and positive, increasing Y points down.
<p>
	<dt> -block
<dd>
Assume the format of the next data file is block data. No sets are formed 
by reading block data, and only one set of block data is allowed in an active 
session. To create sets from the block data, use Edit/Block data.
<p>
	<dt> -bxy <i>col1:col2</i>
<dd>
Create sets from a previously read block data. Using -bxy col1:col2,
will create a set using the current set type (default is XY) and using
column <i>col1</i> and column <i>col2</i> from the most recently read set 
of block data. <i>Col1</i> and <i>col2</i> are integers indicating the 
numbers of the columns - column numbers start from 1. For example:

<pre>
  xmgr -block block.d -bxy 1:4 -bxy 2:6
</pre>

  will read block.d and generate 2 sets of type XY using columns
  1 and 4 for the first set, and 2 and 6 for the second set.

<pre>
  xmgr -block block.d -type xydy -bxy 1:3:4
</pre>

  will read  block.d and generate a set of type XYDY (an XY set with
  error bars) using column 1 and 3 for X and Y, and column 4 for the
  error bars.

<p>
	<dt> -log <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> or <i>xy</i>
<dd>
Set the current graph type to logarithmic depending the the string <i>x</i> 
or <i>y</i> or both axes by <i>xy</i>.
<p>
	<dt> -parameter <i>parameter_file</i>
	<dt> -p <i>parameter_file</i>
<p>
Read the parameter file parameter_file.
<p>
	<dt> -pexec <i>parameter_string</i>
<dd>
Interpret <i>parameter_string</i> as a parameter setting.
<p>
	<dt> -result <i>result_file</i>
<dd>
Write results from regression to result_file 
<p>
	<dt> -rvideo
<dd>
Exchange the color indices for black and white.
<p>
	<dt> -mono
<dd>
Limit colors to black and white, affects the display only.
<p>
	<dt> -dc
<dd>
Allow double click canvas operations, overriding any application default 
setting.
<p>
	<dt> -nodc
<dd>
Disallow double click canvas operations.
<p>
	<dt> -redraw
<dd>
Redraw the entire page if xmgr receives an Expose event.
<p>
	<dt> -noredraw
<dd>
Do not redraw the entire page when Expose events are received.
<p>
	<dt> -statusredraw
<dd>
Redraw the entire page after each command in the status window.
<p>
	<dt> -nostatusredraw
<dd>
Do not redraw the entire page after each command in the status window.
<p>
	<dt> -maxcolors <i>number_of_colors</i>
<dd>
Set the maximum number of colors allocated. For example:
<pre>
xmgr -maxcolors 18 -pexec "cmap 17,255,0,255"
</pre>
Sets the maximum number of colors to 18 and sets color 17 to cyan. Colors
0-15 are set to the defaults, color 16 is undefined (the actual color will
vary).
<p>
	<dt> -freecolors
<dd>
Attempt to free colors which are assigned a different colormap entry.
See <CODE>-nofreecolors</CODE> below.  This is the default behavior.
<p>
	<dt> <A NAME="freeColorsSW">-nofreecolors</A>
<dd>
Doesn't attempt to free colors which are assigned a different colormap
entry.  Use this if one of the colors you use is the same as one of the
button or border colors and you subsequently change that color.  This
shouldn't be a problem unless you're really unlucky.  Using this switch
can cause you to eat up all the colors in your colormap if you change colors
a lot during a session.  This is equivalent to setting the X resource 
<A HREF="#freeColorsXR"><CODE>XMgr.freeColors</CODE></A> to false.
<p>
	<dt> -world <i>xmin ymin xmax ymax</i>
<dd>
Set the scaling of the axes for the current graph. The X axis will
run from <i>(xmin, xmax)</i> the Y axis from <i>(ymin, ymax)</i>
<p>
	<dt> -view <i>xmin ymin xmax ymax</i>
<dd>
Set the viewport of the current graph to a rectangle described by 
<i>(xmin, ymin)</i> and <i>(xmax, ymax)</i>.
<p>
	<dt> -source <i>data_source</i>
<dd>
Set source for the next data file, the argument takes on the following values: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>  <b>disk</b>     - Data file is on disk.
<li>  <b>pipe</b>     - Read from a pipe.
<li>  <b>stdin</b>    - xmgr is in a pipe, read from standard input.
</ul>
<p>
The source setting stays in effect until the next -source command is given.
<p>
	<dt> -pipe
<dd>
Read from standard input and plot each set when the end of the set is seen. 
Use the -pipe option to monitor the results coming from a model or other 
data stream.
<p>
	<dt> -npipe
<dd>
Read data from <A HREF="npipe.html">named pipe</A>. This option can be used to 
display data in real-time, but in contrast with the simple pipe option, xmgr's
graphic user interface remains responsive to your actions while displaying the
data. 
<p>
	<dt> -remove
<dd>
Erase the most recently read file. Use this option when using xmgr to read 
a temporarily constructed file that is not needed once read. Note that this 
option does not request confirmation.
<p>
	<dt> -legend load
<dd>
For each data set read, make the set legend label the same as the filename 
the data set originated.
<p>
	<dt> -seed <i>seed_value</i>
<dd>
Initialize the random number generator using seed <i>seed_value</i>. This 
value is used in a call to the math library function srand48().
<p>
	<dt> -GXinvert
	<dt> -GXxor
<dd>
GXinvert and GXxor set the type of graphics operation used to draw 
rubberband lines and draw the graph focus markers. In a color-mapped 
display, the xor of a source and destination pixel may not generate a 
color visible on the drawing area. The default is to use xor to draw 
rubberband lines, if the lines don't show, try -GXinvert. This draw mode 
can be set via X resource settings (see below).
<p>
	<dt> -maxsets <i>number_of_sets</i>
<dd>
Set the maximum number of data sets per graph. <i>Number_of_sets</i> must 
be greater than 30. If -maxsets is used in conjunction with -maxgraph, 
then the -maxsets setting must precede the -maxgraph setting.
<p>
	<dt> -maxgraph <i>number_of_graphs</i>
<dd>
Set the maximum number of graphs per session. <i>Number_of_graphs</i> must 
be greater than 10. If -maxgraph is used in conjunction with -maxsets, 
then -maxsets must precede the use of -maxgraph.
<p>

	<dt> -maxboxes <i>number_of_boxes</i>
<dd>
Set the maximum number of boxes.
<p>
	<dt> -maxstr <i>number_of_strings</i>
<dd>
Set the maximum number of strings.
<p>
	<dt> -maxlines <i>number_of_lines</i>
<dd>
Set the maximum number of lines.
<p>

<h2><a NAME="defaults">Setting xmgr defaults</a></h2>
<p>

On startup xmgr will look for a <b>.xmgrrc</b> file in 
the users' home directory allowing changes to the default behavior of 
xmgr. The construction of the xmgr default file is the same as for a 
parameter file.
<p>

<HR>

<p>
<h2><a NAME="xdefaults">Setting xmgr X defaults</a></h2>
<p>

The following X resource settings are supported:
<p>
<ul>
	<li> XMgr.invertDraw: False
<p>
Use GXinvert to draw rubberband lines and the graph focus markers if this 
resource is set to True.
<p>
	<li> XMgr.reverseVideo: False
<p>
A boolean resource used to exchange the color indices for black and white.
<p>
	<li> XMgr.maxSets: 30
<p>
Set the number of sets per graph.
<p>
	<li> XMgr.maxGraphs: 10

cancel any  operation performed. 
<p>
	<li> XMgr.allowDoubleClick: Yes
<p>
When Yes, allow double clicks on the canvas to bring up various popups
depending on  the location of the pointer when the double click occurs. Double
clicking to the right of  a graph brings up the View/Ticks popup set to the
Y-axis, below the graph brings up the  View/Ticks popup set to the X-axis,
inside the graph brings up the files popup if no sets  are active or the
View/Symbols popup set to the set nearest the pointer. Double clicking  above
the graph brings up the View/Title-subtitle popup, to the right of the graph,
the  View/Legend popup.
<p>
The command line option to set this resource is -dc or -nodc.
<p>
	<li> XMgr.autoscaleOnRead: No
<p>
When this resource is Yes or True, allow autoscaling to occur each time a set
is read  from the File/Read sets popup.
<p>
	<li> XMgr.backingstore: No
<p>
Have xmgr handle backing store if the server doesn't. 
<p>
The command line option for this is -bs or -nobs.
<p>
<LI><A NAME="freeColorsXR">XMgr.freeColors: True</A>
<P>
See documentation for the command line option

operation in the status window. This takes effect only if
allowStatusRedraw is on. The corresponding command line options are
-statusredraw and -nostatusredraw.
<P>
<LI> XMgr.noAsk: No
<P>
Controls whether or not xmgr generates a warning before overwriting
existing files. The corresponding command line option is -noask.
<P>
<LI> XMgr.logWindow: No
<P>
Controls whether or not xmgr opens the log window on startup. The
corresponding command line options are -logwindow and -nologwindow.
</ul>
It is also possible to customize menus by assigning key accelerators to any item.
<br>
The list below describes the menu labels and related X resources. For example, 
in order to make xmgr popup the Non-linear curve fitting by pressing Control+F,
you would add the following two lines
<P>
XMgr*transformationsMenu.nonLinearFit.acceleratorText: Ctrl+F<BR>
XMgr*transformationsMenu.nonLinearFit.accelerator: Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;f<BR>
<P>

<h2><a NAME="environment">Environment variables</a></h2>

<p>
<ul>
	 <li> GR_HOME
<p>
Set the location of xmgr. This will be where help files, auxiliary programs,
and examples are located. If you are unable to find the location of this
directory, contact your system administrator.
<p>
	 <li> GR_PS_PRSTR
<p>
Set the command string to use for spooling to a PostScript printer. The default 
(unless changed during the build process) is "lpr -h".
<p>
	 <li> GR_MIF_PRSTR
<p>
Set the command string to use for printing the FrameMaker .mif format. The 
default (unless changed during the build process) is "cat &lt acegr.mif &gt ", 
i.e., output is to a file.
<p>
	<li> GR_HPGL_PRSTR
<p>
Set the command string to use for spooling to an HPGL capable printer or
plotter.
<p>
	 <li> GR_HDEV
<p>
Select the hardcopy device. 
<p>
The device numbering is as follows:
<ul>
	<li> 1.	 PostScript landscape
	<li> 2.	 PostScript portrait
	<li> 3.	 FrameMaker interchange format (.mif) landscape
	<li> 4.	 FrameMaker interchange format (.mif) portrait.
	<li> 5.	 HPGL landscape
	<li> 6.	 HPGL portrait
	<li> 7.	 Interleaf landscape
	<li> 8.	 Interleaf portrait
	<li> 9.  PSTeX include
	<li> 10. PSTeX landscape
	<li> 11. PSTeX portrait
</ul>
<p>
	 <li> GR_EDITOR
<p>
Set the name of the editor to use in Data/Edit-Create set. If the editor
must run in a terminal, the terminal must explicitly be provided.
The default value is "xterm -e vi".
</ul>

<p>
	<h2><a NAME="batch">Batch printing</a></h2>
<p>
Executing xmgr as <b>grbatch</b> suppresses the initialization of the 
graphical user interface and allows hardcopy plots to be made without 
intervention. 

<p>

<HR>
<p>
	<h2><a NAME="pstex">PSTeX format</a></h2>
<p>
PSTeX format is a way to combine Postscript output with LaTeX's superior
mathematical formatting ability and symbol set.
PSTeX format produces 2 files, an encapsulated Postscript file
and a LaTeX file which has the commands to read in the EPS file and 
superimpose on top of it any text you want formatted by LaTeX. 
<p>
Any
text beginning with the sequence "\L" is assumed to be a LaTeX
command and will not be present in the EPS file. The EPS file will
have the suffix ".pstex" while the suffix for a LaTeX included file 
is ".pstex_t"
and for a complete LaTeX file is ".tex". An included file is meant to be
read into a LaTeX document by the "\input" LaTeX command while a
complete file may be processed by LaTeX as is.
The PSTeX portrait and landscape devices produce complete files in the
appropriate orientation.
The file produced by the include device is always in a portrait orientation 
and it is a trivial matter to rotate the graph
if desired by the file which reads in the ".pstex_t" file.
<p>
Note: This format may only be written to a file as it must be further processed
and may not be sent directly to the printer.
<p>
If a legend label contains LaTeX code, the legend width must be selected 
manually through the "Legends" popup as xmgr does not process LaTeX commands
and cannot determine the width of the output of such.
<p>
The LaTeX package "graphics" is required or another one with similar
functionality.
