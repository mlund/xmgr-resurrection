	<h3> <a NAME="readsets">Read sets</a> </h3>
<p>
Read one or more data sets. The list item at the top of the popup displays 
the contents of the current directory. Select a file or directory by clicking 
on the item with the right mouse button. The selection is placed in the text 
item labeled `File:' and checked to see if it is a directory or a file. 
Selecting a directory causes xmgr to change to the new directory and 
reload the file list with the contents of the new directory. Selecting a 
file does nothing until the `Accept' button is pressed or &lt return &gt is 
entered. Before `Accept'ing the file, the items describing the file type, file 
source, and the graph in which to read the data need to be properly set.
The type of data file can be one of several formats:
<p>
<ul>
	<li> A 2 column multi-data set file. Sets are separated by a line 
containing non-numeric characters, that are neither comment lines (lines 
with a `#' in column 1) nor parameter lines (lines beginning with an `@'). 
The sets generated from this file type are all of type XY.
<p>
	<li> A multi column data file. X is assumed to be in the first 
column, and Y1, Y2, ..., up to Y30 in the remaining columns. The sets 
generated with this data file format are all of type XY.
<p>
	<li> IHL format. A 3 column data file with the first line 
an integer value with the number of points to follow.
<p>
	<li> Binary format. - not defined as of this writing.
<p>
	<li> X Y DX format. A 3 column data file consisting of X, Y and a 
quantity used to form an error bar parallel to the X-axis, i.e., the point 
will be plotted with an error bar at (X+-DX, Y).
<p>
	<li> X Y DY format. A 3 column data file consisting of X, Y and a 
quantity used to form an error bar parallel to the Y-axis, i.e., the point 
will be plotted with an error bar at (X, Y+-DY).
<p>
	<li> X Y DX1 DX2 format. A 4 column data file consisting of X, Y, 
and the errors in X. The error bar riser is drawn from (X+DX1,Y) to (X-DX2,Y). 
If both DX1 and DX2 are &gt 0 then the error bar will bracket the datum. 
If DX2 is &lt 0 and DX1 &gt 0 the error bars are drawn to the right of the 
datum. Likewise, if DX1 &lt  0 and DX2 &gt  0 the error bar is drawn to the 
left of the datum.
<p>
There are 4 cases for the error bars' position with respect to the datum:
<p>
<ul>
	<li> 1.	DX1 &gt  0 and DX2 &gt  0 ... Error bars bracket the datum.
	<li> 2.	DX1 &gt  0 and DX2 &lt  0 ... Error bars are drawn to the right
	        of the datum.
	<li> 3.	DX1 &lt  0 and DX2 &gt  0 ... Error bars are drawn to the left 
	        of the datum.
	<li> 4.	DX1 &lt  0 and DX2 &lt  0 ... Error bars bracket the datum, but 
	        reversed from case 1.
</ul>
<p>
	<li> X Y DY1 DY2 format. A 4 column data file consisting of X, Y, 
and the errors in Y. The error bar riser is drawn from (X, Y+DY1) to 
(X, Y-DY2). If both DY1 and DY2 are &gt 0 then the error bar will bracket the 
datum. If DY2 is &lt 0 and DY1 &gt  0 the error bars are drawn to the right of 
the datum. Likewise, if DY1 &lt  0 and DY2 &gt  0 the error bar is drawn to the 
left of the datum. There are 4 cases for the error bars' position with 
respect to the datum:
<ul>
	<li> 1.	DY1 &gt  0 and DY2 &gt  0 ... Error bars bracket the datum.
	<li> 2.	DY1 &gt  0 and DY2 &lt  0 ... Error bars are drawn above the 
	        datum.
	<li> 3.	DY1 &lt  0 and DY2 &gt  0 ... Error bars are drawn below the 
	        datum.
	<li> 4.	DY1 &lt  0 and DY2 &lt  0 ... Error bars bracket the datum, but 
	        reversed from case 1.
</ul>
	<li> X Y DX DY format.  A 4 column data file consisting of X, Y, 
and the errors in X and Y. The error bar risers are drawn from (X+DX, Y) to 
(X-DX, Y) and (X, Y+DY) to (X, Y-DY). 
<p>
	<li> X Y Z format. A 3 column data file consisting of X, Y, Z. 
Sets with this type are drawn with the Z value in text at (X, Y).
<p>
	<li> X Y R format. A 3 column data file consisting of X, Y, R. Sets 
with this type are drawn with a circle of radius R at (X, Y).
<p>
	<li> X HI LO OPEN CLOSE format. A 5 column data file consisting of 
the high, low, open and close values for an observation at X. A data set of 
this type uses the line style, line width and line color for a normal set 
when the symbol is drawn. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>Read from:</b> sets the source of the data, either a disk file or a pipe. 
In the case of a pipe, the information provided by the file filter item is 
not used, as the `file' in this case will be a command as typed at the 
UNIX prompt.
<p>
<b>Read to graph:</b> selects a particular graph to serve as the repository 
for the incoming data. The `Current' graph is the graph that has the focus, 
and can be any of the available graphs. If you aren't sure which graph is 
current, the locator item on the main panel displays the current graph number.
<p>
Selecting <b>Autoscale on read:</b> forces an autoscale of the target graph 
each time a set is read. 
<p>
<b>Note</b>: Data are read into the next available set. All data are assumed 
to be delimited by tabs or blanks.
<p>
For the xy, xydx, xydy, xydxdx, xydydy, xydxdy, xyz, xyr data file formats, 
sets are separated by a line containing non-numeric characters, that are 
neither comment lines (lines with a '#' in column 1) nor parameter lines 
(lines beginning with an `@'). Data files can have embedded comments by 
placing a `#' in the first column of the comment line. Plot parameters can 
be set by placing a `@' in the first column of the line followed immediately 
by the parameter name and setting. See the command line reference for a 
description of plot parameters and other commands that may be placed in a 
data file using the `@' character. Comment lines and parameter lines can 
occur at any place in the data file, and are not used to indicate data set 
separators. I recommend a single `&' on a line to use as a data set separator.
<p>
Press <b>Accept</b> to read the data. If the read was successful, the graph 
of the data is drawn using the current plot scaling parameters. If the data 
lies outside the current plotting limits, the new set(s) will not be visible 
until the plotting limits are changed by autoscaling or manually through 
the <a href="plot.html#world"> Plot/World scaling</a>. 
<p>
Press <b>Cancel</b> to close the popup.
<p>
Open the <a href="#status">Status popup</a> to get information on the state of
sets. If reading  the file generates more than 10 errors you'll be prompted by
an alert requesting whether or not  you'd like to continue. These errors
generally arise when an attempt is made to read a  text file - xmgr relies on
the interpretive capabilities of sscanf() to parse the data.  xmgr will read
data sets until there are no more sets available, after the maximum  number of
sets have been used, you'll need to free some sets using the [Kill] or [Kill
all]  items in the Edit/Set operations pullright.

	<h3> <a NAME="readnetcdf">Read netCDF</a> </h3>

<p>
   File/Read netCDF
<p>

   Select X:    Select Y:
<p>

   netCDF file:
<p>
   Load to set:
<p>
   Autoscale on read
<p>

   Accept   Files...   Update   Query   Done
<p>
---------------------------------------
<p>

Enter the name of the netCDF file in the text item labeled
<b>netCDF file:</b> then click on "Update" (note that if -netcdf
[filename] was used on the command line, this step is not
needed, as the lists will be loaded automatically). This will 
read the names of all one dimensional variables into the 
two scrolled lists.  The leftmost list is for X and the 
rightmost for Y. There is an additional item in the X 
list called INDEX (I'm hoping here that no one names a 
variable INDEX, maybe I need to change this) that indicates 
that for X, use the index of the Y variable (numbering 
starts from 1).

<p>
Select on a variable from the X list to use for X and select
a variable from the Y list (only single selections for now). 

<p>
If information about the selected variables is desired, click on 
Query.

<p>
Select a set using "Load to set:" - the default is to load
to the next available set.

<p>
If things look OK, click on Accept to read the data and load 
the set. Use "Autoscale on read" to set/unset autoscaling
after a successful read.

<p>
To read data from a new CDF file, enter the filename, or use
File... to scan the directory. Click on Update to freshen up
the X and Y selection lists.
<p>
Note: Presently, only sets of type XY are created.
<p>
Note: xmgr scans and replaces commas with blanks and the `D' in Fortran double 
precision exponential formats with `e'.

	<h3> <a NAME="readparams">Read parameters</a> </h3>
<p>
Enter the parameter file name on the line labeled "File:", press "Accept" to
read a saved  state of adjustable parameters, legends, strings, etc, to the
graph selected by the `Read to  graph' cycle. As the graph number is saved in
the parameter file this isn't used at the  present time.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="readblock">Read block data</a> </h3>
<p>
Select the data source, either Disk or Pipe and enter the block data file name
in the text  item labeled "File:" to read a data set in block data file format.
The  block data file format consists of columns of data. For example,  the
following is a block data file consisting of 4 columns:
<pre>
    1   2   3   4   5
    6   7   8   9  10
    11 12  13  14  15
</pre>
<p>
After reading the file of block data, the popup will close if no errors were
found, and the  Edit/Block data popup will take its place. Use the functions in
the Edit/Block data  popup to create sets from the block data.
<p>
NOTE: All items are assumed delimited by spaces or tabs. There is presently a
30 column limit. Only one set of block data per session, i.e., reading another
set of block data  will obliterate the previous set of block data.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="writesets">Write sets</a> </h3>
<p>
Write one or all sets to disk. Select the set to write using the cycle
displaying the set  numbers (there is an item for selecting all active sets).
The item denoted "Format" is the  C language format string that will be used to
format the data for output - the default  should work well for most cases.
Enter the file name on the line labeled "File:" and  press the button marked
[Accept], to write the data. The item, `Embed parameters,'  causes xmgr to
write not only the data, but the parameters describing the graph or  graphs as
well.
<p>
A complete dump of the contents of xmgr may be accomplished by selecting all
sets,  embed parameters, and all active graphs. The file generated this way can
then be read as  a normal data file, and should recreate the originating
environment.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="writeparams">Write parameters</a> </h3>
<p>
Select the graph from which to save the parameters. This can be the current
graph, any  particular graph, or all active graphs. Enter the parameter file
name on the line labeled  "Write parameters to", press "Accept" to write the
current state of adjustable parameters, legends, strings, etc. A prompt will
appear if the action would overwrite an existing  file. allowing the operation
to be canceled.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="clearall">Clear all</a> </h3>
<p>
Kill all sets, graphs, and annotative text, lines, and boxes. After performing
this action,  it will be necessary to activate a graph using
View/Graphs/Activate graphs.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="print">Print</a> </h3>
<p>
Generate a hardcopy of the current plot on the device specified in the
File/Printer setup  popup.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="printersetup">Printer setup</a> </h3>
<p>
Set the hardcopy device parameters. Select the device, where to print (either
the printer  or a file), and the string to use as a spooling command for the
print job, or file name if  output is directed to disk. Click on the `Accept'
button to make the selections above current, or `Done' to close the popup and
cancel the operation. If the selection is accepted,  the next time File/Print
is selected, hardcopy output will be to the selected device. Click  on the
`Print' button to accept the settings and print a hardcopy.
<p>

<HR>

	<h3> <a NAME="exit">Exit</a> </h3>
<p>
Click on the Exit button to terminate the session with xmgr.
