	<h3> <a NAME="pickops">Pick ops</a> </h3>
<p>
Pick ops use the point in a set nearest to the location of the pointer 
when clicked to select the set for the chosen operation. The nearest
point is determined by the Euclidean distance which can be very different
from the point that is visually closer. As long as there are sets with points,
the operation will always be performed, which means that a bit of care should
be exercised using these operations.
<p>
        	<ul>
        	<li> <a NAME="pkill">Kill nearest set</a> 
<p>
Kill the set nearest the pointer.
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="pcopy">Copy nearest set</a> 
<p>
Select a set to copy with one click, and the destination, which may be
in another graph, with another click.
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="pmove">Move nearest set</a> 
<p>
Select a set to move with one click, and the destination, which may be
in another graph, with another click.
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="preverse">Reverse nearest set</a> 
<p>
Select a set to reverse by clicking near a point in a set. The result
is that the order of the points is reversed (point N becomes point 1, and point
1 becomes point number N, etc.).
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="pdeact">De-activate nearest set</a> 
<p>
Select a set to deactivate by clicking near a point in a set. The result
is that the set will act as if undefined for most operations, and will not
be drawn even if the line or symbol selections would cause it to be
drawn. The data are not destroyed, and the set can be reactivated using the
functions in File/Status or Data/Set ops.
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="pjoin">Join nearest sets</a> 
<p>
Click near a point in one set to use for the join, then click again
near a point in another set to select the second set. The second set will
be appended to the end of the first set.
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="pdel">Delete range in nearest set</a> 
<p>
Click near a point in one set to use for the start of the range to delete,
then again near the point at the end of the range to delete. The result
is that all points between the 2 selected points will be removed from the
set, including the 2 points selected.
<p>
        	<li> <a NAME="pcancel">Cancel operation</a> 
<p>
Cancel any operation in progress.
        	</ul>
<p>
The remaining items in the Set ops toolbox allow sets to be created, 
destroyed, written to disk, moved, sorted, deactivated, reactivated.

the actual location, i.e. set number,  of the set is not retained in the 
Save file. For example after several operations that create and delete
sets, the active sets are numbered:

0, 3, 4, 5, 9

Following a Pack, the active sets will be numbered:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
